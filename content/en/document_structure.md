It is constructed automatically by the conversion tool and only appears in the HTML & PDF generated documents.

### DOÂ´s

* Choose unique titles for the sections, subsections, tables and figures
* Avoid using special characters in the titles. It makes difficult to establish links inside of the document to a particular section.
* Try to create titles for section, figures and tables that are short and without special characters
