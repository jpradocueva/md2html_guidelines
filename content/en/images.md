This is how an `image` is written in markdown:

```md

```
or
```md
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3258579/124534970-30fdbe00-ddca-11eb-8a95-ca7dd82eba41.png)

```
In addition of using this markdown constructor, is also possible to use a HTML constuctor [`<figure>`](md2html-extended#figures). This constructor, allows to integrate the image in the [`Index`](md2html-extended#indexes) table and apply the same `Cascade Style Sheets` across all the figures.
